# Contributing Guide

Thank you for taking the time to contribute!

## How to contribute
1. Create an issue before starting any new feature or fix.
2. Create a new branch for your work:
   - `feature/your-feature-name`
   - `fix/your-bug-name`
3. Write clean code and meaningful commit messages.
4. Create a Pull Request (PR) to the `dev` branch.
5. Resolve review comments (CodeRabbit + human review).
6. Once approved, your PR will be merged.

## Commit Message Rules
Use this format:
- feat: new feature
- fix: bug fix
- docs: documentation
- refactor: code restructure

## PR Rules
- PR must be small (not 1000+ lines).
- PR must link to an issue.
- Must pass CodeRabbit review.
- Must not include secrets or passwords.
